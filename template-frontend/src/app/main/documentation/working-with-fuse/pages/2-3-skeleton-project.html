            <p>
                We have included a Skeleton Project into the template package for you to start creating your own
                application without having to cleanup all the demo content from the demo application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skeleton Project is exactly the same as our demo application. You can setup the Skeleton Project just
                like the demo application, there is absolutely no difference between two of them except the demo
                content.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want you to start creating your own application using the Skeleton Project so whenever you download
                the template from Themeforest, you will find that the <b>Fuse-1.x.x.zip</b> file is the Skeleton
                Project. If you want to setup the demo application, you can use <b>Fuse-1.x.x-demo.zip</b> file. The
                installation process is exactly the same, just use the demo application zip file rather than the
                Skeleton Project zip file.
