            <span class="h3 section-title">Building? What is that?</span>
            <p>
                As we mentioned earlier, Fuse is more than a traditional admin template. It's more of a base application
                that you can start working with in order to speed up your development process. Once you finish your
                development, you can build the application. Building process is a combination of couple other processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mainly, after building your application, all your html files are going to be injected into a single
                javascript file and they will become entities in the Angular's <b>$templateCache</b> service. All your
                style and javascript files will be minified and uglified. And most importantly, you will be able to
                run your application from a simple host without needing Node.js, Gulp or any other tools we mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your app will become a simple HTML/Javascript application.
            </p>
            <!-- / BUILDING? WHAT IS THAT? -->

            <!-- BUILDING -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Building</span>
            <p>
                To build your application, simply run the following command in your favorite console application
                (Terminal, Command Prompt etc.) and wait for it to finish:
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    gulp build
                </hljs>
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's it. Now the production version of your app is living under the <b>/dist</b> directory within
                your work folder. You can directly upload the contents of <b>/dist</b> folder to your server, and it
                will work.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> If you are going to work within a subfolder, you need to edit the <b>index.html</b> file
                and modify the following line according to your directory structure:
                <hljs lang="html" class="source-code">
                    <base href="/">
                </hljs>
                For example, if you are going to work from a folder called <b>fuse</b> in your host, then you have to
                modify the base link like this:
                <hljs lang="html" class="source-code">
                    <base href="/fuse/">
                </hljs>
            </p>
            <!-- / BUILDING -->

            <!-- BUILDING FOR DEVELOPMENT -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Building for development</span>
            <p>
                Since version <b>1.2.0</b>, we have added a new console command to build your application into a
                development mode. The main difference is, by running this command, the minification and uglifying
                processes will be skipped so you can use Fuse in a more traditional way (including it to your own
                MVC application etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Before running any command though, you must do one modification in the <b>index.html</b> file. This
                modification is required for this command to work properly. Also, after running this command, you should
                revert the changes in order to keep using Fuse with commands like <span
                    class="text-boxed">gulp serve</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Replace the following lines from <b>index.html</b> file:
            </p>
            <img src="assets/docs/build-dev-before.png">
            <p>
                with these:
            </p>
            <img src="assets/docs/build-dev-after.png">
            <p>
                And then to build your application into the development mode, use the following command:
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    gulp build:dev
                </hljs>
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                <b>Note:</b> We added this command on popular demand. This is way outside of the intended use of the
                Fuse and we do NOT recommend it. Also because we didn't develop the Fuse for the uses like this, we
                won't be able to support you and your app if you choose to go this way.
            </p>
            <!-- BUILDING FOR DEVELOPMENT -->

            <!-- HTACCESS -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">.htaccess</span>
            <p>
                Fuse uses HTML5 mode in its location service. It means, you will see URLs like
                <b>www.example.com/mail</b> rather than seeing URLs like this one: <b>www.example.com/#/mail</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, without following .htaccess rules, you can't access your application directly. So typing <b>www.example.com/mail</b>
                to the url bar or refreshing your application will cause an Internal Server Error.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create an <b>.htaccess</b> that stays with the same directory as your <b>index.html</b> and paste the
                following code inside it:
<pre class="source-code"><code style="background:none">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    # Send all requests to the index.html unless
    # it's a directory or a file that actually exists
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></pre>
