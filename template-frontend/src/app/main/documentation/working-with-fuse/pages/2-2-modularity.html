            <p>
                Fuse has a very modular structure and because of it, it's very easy to add new modules or remove any of
                the available modules from the app. As an example for the modular structure, we can take a look at the
                Mail application:
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="assets/docs/mail-modular-structure.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                It might look a little bit too much complicated at first but given enough time, you will realise that
                working with a modular structure is a lot easier than putting everything together.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, you can see that everything related to our Mail app is in one location. Translations,
                styles, different pages, dialogs, sidenavs etc. they all are in one place. This will not only make
                managing your app easier, it also allows you to add/remove modules (even in runtime) without creating
                wholes or dead-ends in your application.
            </p>

            <!-- ADDING A MODULE -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Adding a Module</span>
            <p>
                To add a new module, simply put your module files into your preferred location inside the <span
                    class="text-boxed">app/</span> directory and then add the module name as a dependency into the
                <span class="text-boxed">app/index.module.js</span> file.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't need worry about injecting any of your module files into anywhere else as <b>Yeoman generator
                for AngularJS with GulpJS</b> does that automatically. It will automatically find your controllers,
                directives, html templates, css files etc. and it will inject them into correct locations.
            </p>

            <!-- REMOVING A MODULE -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Removing a Module</span>
            <p>
                Removing a module is very easy too. All you have to do is to locate the module name from dependency list
                inside the <span class="text-boxed">app/index.module.js</span> file and remove it. Then you can remove
                the actual module files. Just like adding a new module, you don't have to worry about any leftover
                injectors as they were automatically injected by <b>Yeoman generator for AngularJS with GulpJS</b>.
