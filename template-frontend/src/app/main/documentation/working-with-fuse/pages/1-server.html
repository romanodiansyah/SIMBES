            <!-- SERVER -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Server</span>
            <p>
                As we mentioned before, Fuse uses <b>Yeoman generator for AngularJS with GulpJS</b> for quickly
                bootstrapping the application and it comes with a built-in server setup so you don't have to worry about
                setting up a server for your development environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The built-in server setup uses <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/" target="_blank">browser-sync</a>.
                There are a lot of benefits of using browser-sync such as testing your app in multiple browser windows
                and even across multiple devices. Browser-sync will synchronise your actions such as clicking and
                scrolling across browser windows and devices to make testing easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start the server, run the following command in your favorite console application (Terminal, Command
                Prompt etc.) while in your work folder:
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    gulp serve
                </hljs>
            </p>
            <p class="mt-32">
                This will start up the server, compile scss files, inject dependencies, and will do all other related
                jobs for you. Then it will automatically fire up your default browser and redirect you to the
                <b>http://localhost:3000</b> by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can check out your console application to get further information about the server. By default, it
                will run on <b>http://localhost:3000</b> but it might change depending on your setup.
            </p>
            <!-- / SERVER -->

            <!-- RELOADING THE SERVER -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Reloading the Server</span>
            <p>
                The <span class="text-boxed">gulp serve</span> command will watch your files and reload the page for you as you make changes.
                But for some reason, if you need to manually restart the server, you can do it by pressing <b>Ctrl +
                C</b> on your keyboard while in the console application and then run the following command once again:
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    gulp serve
                </hljs>
            </p>
