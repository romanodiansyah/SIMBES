            <p>
                Here you can see the directory structure of the Fuse:
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                <b>Note:</b> This directory structure is from the demo application. Skeleton project may have a
                slightly different structure.

                <div class="pl-32" flex>
                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">app/core</span>
                    <p>
                        Contains all the core elements that required for Fuse to work. It's highly recommended NOT to
                        touch or modify anything inside the core directory so you can easily update the template when
                        a new version released.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">app/data</span>
                    <p>
                        Contains all the json files that holds demo data. We are using json files to emulate API calls
                        and the data flow. These json files are good for seeing the data structure we are using in our
                        demo applications so you can use similar data structure to minimize your work.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">app/main</span>
                    <p>
                        Contains all the modules from theme demo. Apps, Components, Custom Pages and everything else you
                        can see in the theme demo are located in this directory.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">app/navigation</span>
                    <p>
                        Contains the main navigation sidenav.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">app/quick-panel</span>
                    <p>
                        Contains the extra sidenav called Quick Panel.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">app/toolbar</span>
                    <p>
                        Contains the main toolbar module. It's separated from the core as the same reason with the
                        sidenav modules.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">index.***.js</span>
                    <p>
                        These files are the entry point of the main (fuse) application. Fuse is an Angular module by
                        itself. It means you can either create your app on top of the Fuse, or you can add Fuse as
                        another module into your current project. Keep in mind, adding Fuse into your own app as a
                        module might require some extra work.
                    </p>

                    <span class="h3 sub-section-title">index.scss</span>
                    <p>
                        This is the main scss file. DO NOT REMOVE it as all the other scss files will be injected into
                        this file before compiled to a css file.
