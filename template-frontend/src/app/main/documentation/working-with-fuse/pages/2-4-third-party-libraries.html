            <p>
                Fuse uses <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a> package manager to manage third-party
                libraries. Combined with the generator, you can add, remove or update third-party libraries in a matter
                of seconds.
            </p>

            <!-- ADDING A THIRD PARTY LIBRARY -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Adding a Third-Party Library</span>
            <p>
                To add a third party library to your application, open your favorite console application (Terminal,
                Command Prompt etc.), navigate to your work folder and run the following command by replacing the <b>PACKAGE_NAME</b>
                with the actual name of the package you want to uninstall:
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    bower install PACKAGE_NAME --save
                </hljs>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are installing an AngularJS module, then you have to add it as a dependency to your application.
                You can do that either in <span class="text-boxed">/app/core/core.module.js</span> file or in
                <span class="text-boxed">/app/index.module.js</span> file.

            <!-- REMOVING A THIRD PARTY LIBRARY -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Removing a Third-Party Library</span>
            <p>
                To remove a third party library from your application, open your favorite console application (Terminal,
                Command Prompt etc.), navigate to your work folder and run the following command by replacing the <b>PACKAGE_NAME</b>
                with the actual name of the package you want to install:
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    bower uninstall PACKAGE_NAME --save
                </hljs>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are uninstalling an AngularJS module, make sure you remove it from your dependencies lists as
                well. You can check both <span class="text-boxed">/app/core/core.module.js</span> file and
                <span class="text-boxed">/app/index.module.js</span> file to make sure you remove the dependency
                injections.
            </p>
            <!-- / REMOVING A THIRD PARTY LIBRARY -->

            <p class="note">
                <b>Note:</b> Other than adding or removing package names to or from the dependency lists, you shouldn't
                need to anything else to include the actual library into your application. Just reload your server and
                everything will be injected automatically.
            </p>

            <p class="note">
                <b>Note:</b> Sometimes, bower packages might have dependencies to other packages. Normally, uninstalling
                a package will remove its dependencies only if those dependencies are not in use. If you find yourself
                with lots of unnecessary packages in your <b>bower_components</b> folder, running
                <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                    bower prune
                </hljs>
                command will remove all the unnecessary packages. This should only uninstall the packages that are
                not in use, but you should still be careful. Bower will output the names of the removed modules to the
                console, so pay attention when you run the above command and make sure it didn't remove any important
                packages.
