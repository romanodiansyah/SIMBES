                <li>
                    Unzip the zip file that you have downloaded from Themeforest. Inside the zip file, you will find the
                    Skeleton Project <b>(Fuse-1.x.x.zip)</b> along with the Demo Project <b>(Fuse-1.x.x-demo.zip)</b>,
                    PSD designs and a readme file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For this documentation, we will be using the Skeleton Project which is the exact same template minus
                    the demo content so you don't have to clean up the demo content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extract the contents of the zip file <b>(Fuse-1.x.x.zip)</b> into a folder that you will
                    work within. For this documentation, we will refer that as "<em>your work folder</em>".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open your favorite console application (Terminal, Command Prompt etc.), navigate into your work
                    folder, run the following command and wait for it to finish:
                    <hljs lang="bash" class="source-code">
                        npm install
                    </hljs>

                    <p>
                        This command will install all the required Node.js modules into the <b>node_modules</b>
                        directory inside your work folder.
                    </p>

                        <b>Note:</b> Installing Node.js packages may throw a lot of warnings and errors along the way.
                        As long as the process finishes without any error notes such as "Killed", you will be fine.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>

                        bower install

                    <p>
                        This command will install all the required bower packages into the <b>bower_components</b>
                        directory inside your work folder.
                    </p>

                <p>And now, you are ready to run the Fuse for the first time.</p>

                    While still in your work folder, run the following command in the console application:

                <p>
                    And that's it. Gulp will take care everything and start the Fuse. Your default browser will be
                    opened automatically, and you will be able to navigate through the template.
