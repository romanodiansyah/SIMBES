                This section will give you some information about what tools you will need. You can skip to the <b>Installation</b>
                section to start installing the template. We already mentioned all the prerequisites and how to install
                them in the <b>Installation</b> section.

                Fuse uses <a href="https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular" target="_blank">Yeoman generator for
                AngularJS with GulpJS</a> for quickly bootstrapping the application. You can check out the link for more
                detailed information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simply, <em><b>Yeoman generator for AngularJS with GulpJS</b></em> will automatically inject any
                templates, controllers, modules, directives and other application related files into the index.html file
                for you. It will also automatically find and compile scss files into one css file and inject that one
                as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's really easy to develop your Angular applications with the generator. We are highly recommending
                you to check out the above link and learn more about it before getting started.

            <!-- NODE.JS -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Node.js</span>
            <p>
                To install and use Fuse, you will need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
                installed to your computer. We won't get into too much detail about Node.js as it's out of the scope
                of this documentation. Also you won't need to actually use Node.js, it's only required for the
                development process.

            <!-- GIT -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Git</span>
            <p>
                To be able to install and use Fuse, you will also need <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>
                installed to your computer. Git is required for <b>bower</b> to work correctly.

            <!-- BOWER -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Bower</span>
            <p>
                Fuse uses <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a> package manager to install and manage 3rd
                party components and libraries.
            </p>

            <!-- GULP -->
            <span class="h3 section-title">Gulp</span>
            <p>
                <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> is required for Fuse to work properly. Although
                there are ways to develop with Fuse without using Gulp or Node.js, we strongly recommend you to use them
                in order to take advantage of the true power of the Fuse.
